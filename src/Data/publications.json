        "abstract":"People experiencing severe distress increasingly use Large Language Model (LLM) chatbots as mental health support tools. Discussions on social media have described how engagements were lifesaving for some, but evidence suggests that general-purpose LLM chatbots also have notable risks that could endanger the welfare of users if not designed responsibly. In this study, we investigate the lived experiences of people who have used LLM chatbots for mental health support. We build on interviews with 21 individuals from globally diverse backgrounds to analyze how users create unique support roles for their chatbots, fill in gaps in everyday care, and navigate associated cultural limitations when seeking support from chatbots. We ground our analysis in psychotherapy literature around effective support, and introduce the concept of therapeutic alignment, or aligning AI with therapeutic values for mental health contexts. Our study offers recommendations for how designers can approach the ethical and effective use of LLM chatbots and other AI mental health support tools in mental health care."

        "abstract":"God-Saeng is a phenomenon among South Korean Gen-Z, epitomizing diligence, routine-based productivity, and well-being, in which people achieve it by committing themselves to practices such as going to the gym every morning. We conducted interviews and a 10-day probe study (N=24) to understand its perception, practice, and underlying aspirations. Our findings reveal a complex interplay between the aspirations for an ideal lifestyle and the pressures of societal expectations, highlighting a broad spectrum from genuine self-improvement to coping with societal expectations, revealing technology's focus on immediate behaviors rather than deeper aspirations or Gen-Z's complex realities. We further discuss the crucial role of recognizing and aligning with one’s underpinning values amidst external influences on perceptions of wellness. This awareness fosters a more authentic path to well-being, guiding the design of technology that supports holistic well-being."
